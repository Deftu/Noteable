## But... Why?
It's cool! And it's very helpful for managing big projects
in your survival worlds, or in servers with friends!

# Do my notes save?
Yes! They save and will be restored when you restart your
game.

# How do I set it up/how do I add/edit/delete/move/pin notes?
This **requires** [Mod Menu][modmenu]. The config screen can
be access by clicking on Noteable's entry in the mod menu
screen.
